-Notes on installation-
(Not definitive, just based on my experience)

1. Before being able to run this simulation you'll need to install and set up
   Geant4.
   I found this very helpful:

2. To veiw the graphs, you might want to install root, though there are other
   (inferior) alternatives.
3. Before making the PadmeMC binary, initialise environment variables.
   a. source geant4.10.04-build/geant4make.sh (or .csh as the case may be)
   b. source padmefw/Configure/padme_init.sh
4. You can make the monte carlo simulation with the help of the GNUmakefile
   in PadmeMC.
   In PadmeMC, run make
   If you get errors realting to DYLIB, you might have to set some paths,
   refer to .setup.sh in PadmeMC to see what worked for me.
5. You'll get an executable in the bin folder.
   Execute it from the PadmeMC directory. (For me, that is
   ./bin/Darwin-clang/PADMEMC)
   Going further in will cause macro problems.

NOTE:
Before you 'make' the simulation, some environment variables (in the padme
repository, but also for geant4) need to be set. For my convenience I wrote a
short script that did this for me, .setup.sh, located in PadmeMC directory
(note that it is hidden).
However a part of it relies on the location of my geant4 installation with
respect to the padme repository.
It is assumed that the geant4-build directory would have to be at the same
level as padme-fw, like so:

                   __padme_fw
Some directory ---|
                  |__geant4*version*-build
		
So if you want to use it, you might want to modify the script accordingly.
Maybe even paste it into your bash-rc (linux) or ~/.bash-profile (mac)
if you don't want to have to run it every time.
